# Data Visualization in R

This repository demonstrates the process of data wrangling and interactive visualization in R, utilizing the `ggplot2` and `shiny` packages. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing video game sales data.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `Video_Games_Sales.csv` ‚Äî Contains sales data for various video games.
- **Data Wrangling**: Performed in `data_wrangling.R` to clean and prepare the dataset for visualization.
- **Interactive Application**: Built with `shiny` in `app.R`, allowing users to explore the data through interactive plots.
- **Presentation**: Summarized in `presentation.Rmd`, providing insights and findings from the analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - `ggplot2` for creating static and interactive plots
  - `shiny` for building the web application
  - `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation
  - `readr` for reading CSV files

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)

Install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "shiny", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr"))

```
### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ani-dilanyan/Data-Visualization-in-R.git
cd Data-Visualization-in-R

```
2. Open app.R in RStudio.
3. Click the "Run App" button in RStudio to launch the Shiny application.
